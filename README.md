# Intermediate Machine Learning
  
## About

This repository documents the learnings from completing the [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) course on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

Hands-on project focused on handling missing values, non-numeric values, data leakage, and more.

* `lesson_2`: missing values; getting prepared for missing values in real datasets.

* `lesson_3`: categorical variables; how to use non-numeric data for machine learning.
 
* `lesson_4`: pipelines; a skill for deploying and testing complex models with pre-processing.
 
* `lesson_5`: cross-validation; a better way to test models.
 
* `lesson_6`: XGBoost; the most accurate technique for structured data.

* `lesson_7`: data leakage; finding and fixing it in subtle ways.
